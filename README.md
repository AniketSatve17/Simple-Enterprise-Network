## Introduction

This project designs a basic, secure, and functional network connecting two departments within a company: Accounts and Delivery. The network utilizes Cisco routers and switches to interconnect the departments while maintaining network segmentation for enhanced security. The topology includes two subnets, one for each department, with each subnet containing two PCs and a printer. The project focuses on configuring IP addresses, subnetting the network, and verifying successful communication between devices in both departments.

## The Problem Statement

Design a network to connect two department Accounts and Delivery using CISCO packet through the following points-

• Each department should contain at least two pcs

• Appropriate number of switches and routers should be used in the network

• All interfaces should be configured with appropriate IP addresses subnet mask and gateways

• Then all devices in the network should be connected using appropriate cables

• Finally, we are required to test communication between the accounts and delivery departments.

## How to solve:

1) Download Cisco Packet Tracer: https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/packet-tracer-alternative-lab-solutions
2) Launch and get familiar with the packet tracer environment and its tools.
3) Read the above problem statement and understand it to get started.
4) Drag and drop the components/devices needed as per problem statement: (Router2911, Switch2960-24TT, Pc,)
5) Connect the devices with cable.
6) Give the background color of your choice to differentiate between the departments, I have given Pink: Accounts, Blue: Delivery.
7) Next is Subnetting, you can refer the subnetting provided in the image
